## Log

### R1D1 
Started by learning about git and setting up my environment. Also, I found this platform, https://exercism.org/, which is great for practicing program languages with real-life exercises.

### R1D2
ðŸš€ Just took my first dive into Jest and test running today! Spent 90 mins tackling a basic JavaScript challenge â€“ and yes, the struggle was real. ðŸ’» Learning is a journey, right?

### R1D3
Practicing booleans and logical operators in JS on Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode! ðŸ’»ðŸ’¡ Learning the basics is a crucial step, and I'm embracing the process. Remember, we all start somewhere! What's your recent coding triumph or challenge? Let's inspire each other! 

### R1D4
I solved a problem that was holding me back, basically a node package manager. The tip of the day is to keep your tools up-to-date.


### R1D5
I practiced some basic JavaScript concepts: data types, functions, objects, strings, arrays, and corresponding methods. To remember and practice quick exercises, W3Schools is a great recommendation.
