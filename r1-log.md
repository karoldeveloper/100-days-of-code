## Log

### R1D1 
Started by learning about git and setting up my environment. Also, I found this platform, https://exercism.org/, which is great for practicing program languages with real-life exercises.

### R1D2
First time using jest, also first time doing tests. Spent kinda of 90 minutes to solve a javascript basic problem, hoping get better with time
ðŸš€ Just took my first dive into Jest and test running today! Spent 90 mins tackling a basic JavaScript challenge â€“ and yes, the struggle was real. ðŸ’» Learning is a journey, right?
