The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 13, Saturday, 2024.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started by learning about git and setting up my environment. Also, I found this platform, https://exercism.org/, which is great for practicing program languages with real-life exercises.

### R1D2
ðŸš€ Just took my first dive into Jest and test running today! Spent 90 mins tackling a basic JavaScript challenge â€“ and yes, the struggle was real. ðŸ’» Learning is a journey, right?

### R1D3
Practicing booleans and logical operators in JS on Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode! ðŸ’»ðŸ’¡ Learning the basics is a crucial step, and I'm embracing the process. Remember, we all start somewhere! What's your recent coding triumph or challenge? Let's inspire each other! 

### R1D4
I solved a problem that was holding me back, basically a node package manager. The tip of the day is to keep your tools up-to-date.

### R1D5
I practiced some basic JavaScript concepts: data types, functions, objects, strings, arrays, and corresponding methods. To remember and practice quick exercises, W3Schools is a great recommendation.

### R1D6
Today I practiced math, bigInt, numbers and date objects in JavaScript.

### R1D7
Today I practiced logical and comparison operators, array methods, searching and sorting in javascript

### R1D8
Today I felt very alone and unmotivated in relation to my self-taught programming learning, I felt that I was simply going round and round and didn't have the right direction, which led me to open my heart and ask for help, so as of tomorrow I'm starting to receive mentoring aimed at software development.

### R1D9
Starting with my software engineering mentor, we worked on a plan for the next six months to improve my front-end development skills. And I started by reviewing and practicing the basics of HTML.

### R1D10
I read and practiced the basics of elements, attributes, CSS in HTML, favicon, links, and images.

### R1D11
I read and practiced the basics of tables, block and inline elements, file paths, head, semantic and style guides in HTML.
